# Fake News Blocker

A browser add-on for warning users of fake news sites, parody sites, and other misleading journalistic sources.

Uses the [Politifact Fake News Almanac](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/) as the source for known fake news websites.

The blocker can be toggled by pressing its icon in the browser toolbar.
